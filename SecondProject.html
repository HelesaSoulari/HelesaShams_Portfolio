									<h3 class="major">CUSTOMER CHURN AND PRICING STRATEGY
                                    </h3>
									<p>The aim is to identify the demographics and reasons behind the highest churn rates. The objective is to pinpoint which customers, clients, and stakeholders should be targeted to ensure retention, particularly those who generate the most revenue. We can implement strategies to reduce churn and maintain a profitable customer base by understanding these factors.</p>

									<p>The analysis reveals a significant trend regarding customer churn rates in relation to monthly charges. Specifically, new users exhibit a markedly higher churn rate when faced with high monthly charges. This trend suggests that the initial pricing can be a deterrent, potentially overwhelming new customers before they experience the full value of the service. Conversely, as customers remain with the company over time, their likelihood of churning decreases even as prices increase. This indicates that long-term customers develop a greater loyalty and perceived value, making them more resilient to price hikes.</p>

                                    <p>To optimize customer retention and maximize return on investment (ROI), we propose introducing new clients at a more affordable, lower price point to reduce the initial barrier to entry and allow them to experience the value of our services without a significant financial commitment. Once customers become accustomed to our services and recognize their value, we can gradually increase the monthly charges. This incremental approach can mitigate the risk of early churn and foster long-term customer relationships, effectively lowering the churn rate for new users.</p>

                                    <p>Additionally, we recommend converting monthly customers to yearly or two-year contracts by offering incentives such as discounts, additional features, or exclusive benefits. Implementing attractive incentives, such as a discounted annual rate, bonus services, or loyalty rewards for customers who commit to longer-term plans, will secure long-term revenue and enhance customer loyalty and satisfaction. This strategic approach leverages both pricing flexibility and customer incentives to create a more sustainable and profitable customer base, ultimately achieving better ROI.</p>
