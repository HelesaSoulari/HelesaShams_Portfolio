									<h3 class="major">OPTIMIZING FOOD MARKETING STRATEGIES
                                    </h3>UFood, a top food delivery app in Brazil, aims to boost customer engagement and secure its market leadership. Facing uncertain profit growth, the company is focusing on enhancing marketing campaign performance and seeking data-driven insights to optimize budget use and convince skeptics within the organization.</p>

									<p>The objectives of this project include exploring the data to identify cause-and-effect relationships and provide an understanding of the characteristics of customers who responded to the campaigns. Secondly, it was required to develop and describe customer segments based on their behaviors, allowing for more targeted marketing efforts by grouping customers with similar features. Finally, findings are presented with clear visualizations and well-reasoned explanations to effectively communicate insights to both technical and business stakeholders.</p>

                                    <p>Overall Findings:</p>
                                        1. Age: Customers aged 30-70 spend more but are less likely to accept campaigns, although they represent a significant volume.
                                        2. Sales Channel: Catalog users are more likely to accept campaigns, while in-person shoppers spend more. Recommend a balanced approach: 40% catalog, 30% store, 30% web.
                                        3. Demographics: Target individuals with fewer or no children, as they are more responsive.
                                        4. Education and Marital Status: Education has no significant impact, and marital status plays a minimal role, although married, single, and those in relationships tend to spend more.
                                        <p></p>Strategy:</p>
                                        1. Revenue Growth: Focus on middle-aged, high earners without children, using a balanced approach across platforms.
                                        2. New User Engagement: Target users aged 21-70, who have a higher acceptance rate for campaigns.
                                        </p>
