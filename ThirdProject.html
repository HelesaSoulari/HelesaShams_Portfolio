									<h3 class="major">Bus Breakdowns and Delays in NYC</h3>
									<p>This dataset is from the publicly available New York City data website, with the primary goal of improving the efficiency and reliability of the city's bus transportation system. The city has been experiencing a significant number of bus breakdowns and delays, which have been causing inconvenience to commuters and straining the city's public transportation resources. The goal is to analyze the provided data to identify patterns and factors that contribute to these breakdowns and delays. Based on this dataset, answering three main questions is critical in understanding the trends and finding solutions for bus breakdowns in NYC. The details on data cleaning can be found in the project's original file. 
                                    </p>

									<p>The majority of the breakdowns are occurring due to "Mechanical Problems" or "Won't Start," which also seems to be a mechanical issue. More precautionary maintenance should be done to prevent mechanical problems. Potentially, buses could be serviced monthly or quarterly to reduce these incidents. Overwhelmingly, the main cause of the delays is traffic. One possible solution could be having buses pick up the majority of students at non-high traffic times. Note: There are almost 14,000 delays due to mechanical issues. This could be resolved with the plan for servicing the vehicles regularly to address breakdowns. </p>

                                    <p>Based on the second comparison chart we observe the top 10 companies with the highest delay times. We can use this information to compare the number of delays, boroughs, and the total number of trips. There is a spike in delays on Mondays and a decrease in delays on Fridays. Since the majority of delays are caused by traffic, we can assume the decrease in delays on Fridays is due to fewer people going to work or driving on that day. Also, there is a gradual decrease in breakdowns throughout the week. A higher percentage of breakdowns happen on Mondays, and they decrease throughout the week. It is recommended to schedule maintenance over weekends to help reduce breakdowns during the week.</p>
