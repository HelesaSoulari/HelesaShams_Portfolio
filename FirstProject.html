									<p>The project aims to understand the different parts of US public debt by looking at the portion held by people, businesses, foreign governments, and other entities outside the US government, and the portion held by US government agencies. In this project the aim is to present a comprehensive overview of the total US public debt by combining the external and internal holdings, thus giving a complete picture of the nation's debt obligations.</p>

									<p>Despite historically lower summer increases and a recent significant jump, US public debt has grown steadily. Between 2016 and 2019, the average increase in total public debt outstanding was around 5% annually. However, 2020 saw a significant spike in debt, most likely due to the pandemic responses in the US. Historically, the highest debt increase months are January, February, and December. In contrast, the months with the lowest debt increases are April, May, June, and July. One hypothesis for this pattern is that high spending holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's occur during the high debt increase months, leading people to take on more debt to buy gifts and cover holiday expenses. </p>

                                    <p>Analyzing debt trends over the years, from 1997 to 2007, there was an increase of about 1 trillion in publicly held debt. From 2008 to 2019, the debt surged from 6 trillion to 17 trillion. Between 2020 and 2022, the debt further increased from 21.5 trillion to 25 trillion. Looking ahead, it is projected that by 2027, publicly held debt will reach 33 trillion. In conclusion, publicly held debt has been rising steadily and is expected to continue this upward trend over the next five years. Further research could explore the influences of the stock market, housing market, credit card purchases, and unemployment rates on public debt dynamics.</p>
