									<h3 class="major">WORLD LIFE EXPECTANCY DATA CLEANING AND ANALYSIS</h3>
									<p>This project is divided into two main phases: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The primary objective is to thoroughly clean the dataset and then perform a detailed analysis to uncover global life expectancy trends and investigate various factors influencing life expectancy over the past 15 years. By addressing data quality issues and employing advanced SQL techniques, the project aims to provide actionable insights into the health and economic conditions across different countries.</p>

									<p>
                                        In the data cleaning phase of the project, the main goal was to make sure the data was accurate and consistent. The first step was to find and remove duplicate records for each country and year to avoid any errors in the analysis. We also found and fixed missing values in important columns like the Status column. Errors, such as zero values in life expectancy and GDP data, were spotted and corrected to ensure the data was realistic. These steps were essential to prepare a reliable dataset for further analysis.</p>

                                    <p>During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, various analyses were conducted to gain insights from the cleaned data. The trends in life expectancy over the past 15 years were analyzed for each country, providing a comprehensive view of how life expectancy has evolved. A correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between life expectancy and various factors, including GDP and life mortality rates, to uncover any significant patterns or influences. Additionally, window functions were utilized to calculate the rolling total of life mortality, which offered insights into the total number of deaths per country over the 15-year period. This multifaceted approach to EDA provided a deep understanding of the factors influencing life expectancy and the overall health trends across different countries.</p>
