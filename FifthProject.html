									<h3 class="major">CALL CENTER KPI DASHBOARD ANALYSIS</h3>
									<p>This project was initiated to meet the needs of a manager in the call center (help desk). A monthly KPI (Key Performance Indicator) dashboard was created to track employee performance and provide comprehensive information about the calls. The dashboard I developed delivers valuable insights into this data, which makes it an essential tool for monitoring and decision-making.</p>

									<p>KPI dashboards provide a snapshot of an organization's key metrics or performance indicators. These indicators align with the organization's strategic objectives and goals, enabling stakeholders to monitor progress, identify trends, and make informed decisions. </p>

                                    <p>The dashboard reveals that call volume peaks between 10 AM and 4 PM, with a significant peak around 1 PM, suggesting a need for more staff during these hours to enhance efficiency. Additionally, evaluating agent performance across three key metrics—Resolved Calls by Agent, Resolution Rates by Agent, and Speed of Answer—highlights Martha's exceptional performance in resolution rate and case resolution, and Greg's outstanding answer speed.
                                    </p>
