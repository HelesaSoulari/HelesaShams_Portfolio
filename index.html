											</h2>
											<p>I grew up in a family of engineers, where problem-solving was a natural talent applied to daily life matters. As an outstanding and dedicated student, I balanced my academic pursuits with a deep dedication to equestrian sports. Over eight years, I won numerous horse jumping medals and took on the responsibility of training and caring for my horses. This experience honed my sense of responsibility and commitment. I am now eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to drive further improvements and innovations.</p>
